# The First Homework for Hacker
Interested in functional programming? Try Lean. The Lean proof assistant has been in recent news (e.g., AlphaProofs performance on IMO-style problems). Visit https://www.lean-lang.org/ and get yourself familiar with Lean. Write a Lean program to prove any statement in our lecture notes. Show off your program to your classmates! (If you convince your TA that your program is really cool, well give you three minutes in class for a demonstration.)

## 个人评价
配Lean环境真的比较复杂（哪怕用的是code-server），所以推荐https://live.lean-lang.org/
